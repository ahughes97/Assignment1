					Copyright is a form of intellectual property which gives the creator of original work the right to copy, publish, transmit, and adapt their own material. (Copyright Licensing New Zealand, 2022).<br><br>
					Basic principles of Copyright are:<br>
					1. Copyright applies automatically when something is published.<br>
					2. The Copyright symbol acts as a reminder therefore when it isn't displayed, Copyright still applies.<br>
					3. Everything published is protected by Copyright including print material, computer programmes, music, and page layouts.<br>
					4. Copyright lasts more than a lifetime. In NZ, literary, dramatic, artistic, and musical works stay in place for the lifetime of the creator plus 50 years after their death. (Copyright Licensing New Zealand, 2022).<br>

					<h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
					<img src="Media2/seo.jpg" alt="seo" class="research-img">

				<div class="flip-box-research-back">
					<p class="research-back">
					There are multiple ways to improve the visibility of the website on the search engine. (McCormick, n/d).<br><br>
					1. Target keywords within the website - make sure that each page within the website clearly targets a specfic topic to be noticed more.<br> 
					Conduct keyword research to find the high-volume, relevant keywords and incorporate them into the pages and meta tags.<br>
					2. Add the website to online directories - the more places the website is listed, the more frequently the website will get noticed.<br>
					Examples of online directories include Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google My Business, and Yelp.<br>
					3. Use compelling images - optimise high-quality photos in order to rank in an image search by choosing an appropriate file name, keeping the file size small to reduce load time, and add captions.<br>
					4. Use local media - reach out to local papers, magazines, radio stations, and news channels to direct traffic to the website.<br>
					Placing ads in newspapers and local publications will help bring in newcomers to the website.<br>
					5. Write quality content - to ensure the quality of the content on the website, be sure to dive deep into topics, include images, videos, and other media, aim to provide an experience for the users, and monitor the load times. (McCormick, n/d).<br>

					<h2>Web Publishing</h2>
					<img src="Media2/web-hosting.jpg" alt="publishing" class="research-img">
				</div>
				<div class="flip-box-research-back">
					<p class="research-back">
					There are many factors to consider when evaluating a web hosting provider<br><br>
					1. Average uptime - this is the average amount of time the website stays up within a given time period.
					The uptime is important as it can affect how much traffic the website gets. The website won't be getting much traffic if users can't access it.
					The average uptime should generally be 100% or as clase to it as possible.<br>
					2. Load time - this is the amount of time it takes for a web page to load. The load time affects how much traffic the website gets.
					The slower the web pages' load time, the more frustrated the users get. The web host should provide page load times of 3 seconds or less.<br>
					3. Support - getting helpful customer support means dealing with website problems faster and more effectively.
					Web hosting providers usually offer phone or chat customer support. It's important to have quick responses and knowledgeable team support. (McCormick, n/d).<br>

					<h2>Web Performance and Maintenance</h2>
					<img src="Media2/web-performance.jpg" alt="performance" class="research-img">
				</div>
				<div class="flip-box-research-back">
					<p class="research-back">
					Ways to reduce page loading time:<br>
					1. Compress and optimise the images - large images can delay loading times therefore reducing the image file size can reduce their "weight" and increase loading times.<br>
					2. Reduce the redirects - too many redirects on the website can impact the loading times. Eliminating unnecessary redirects on the website can result in lower page loading times.<br>
					3. Cache the web pages - Caching stores copies of the sites' files therefore minimising the work needed for the server to generate and serve a web page to a users' browser.<br>
					4. Enable browser caching - this enables the browser to store a variety of information including stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files therefore it doesn't have to reload the entire page every time a user visits it.<br>
					5. Use asynchronous and defer loading for CSS and JavaScript files - asynchronous loading enables multiple files to load at the same time which can speed up the pages' performance. (Duò, 2020).<br>
					<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-reduce-your-websites-page-speed">Reference</a><br><br>
					Actions or tasks to carry out when maintaining a website:<br>
					1. Perform yearly usability tests to ensure the website continues to make sense for users across all browsers and devices.<br>
					2. At least once a year check the renewal status of the domain name for the website.<br>
					3. Update the header, footer, and legal policies to keep the information relevant, and to make sure the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are up to date as laws change.<br>
					4. Test out all the forms on the website to ensure they are working on all browsers and devices, and that valuable information isn't missing from forms that aren't working correctly.<br>
					5. Fix any broken links every few months by either removing them or replacing them with updated links. (Rowland, 2021).

				<div class="flip-box-research-back">
					<p class="research-back">
					Common cyber attacks / threats and preventive measures against those attacks:<br><br>
					1. Password based attacks - hackers use techniques and tools to gain access to usernames and passwords including password guessing and password-cracking software.<br>
					Ways to prevent this attack include long passwords, unique passwords, and secure passwords.<br>
					2. Denial of service attacks - scammers send quantities of data to a website, rendering it unusable.<br>
					Ways to prevent this attack include constantly monitoring the website and network traffic to detect unusual occurrences, and keeping the systems up to date.<br>
					3. Social engineering attacks - a common type of this attack is phishing which involves emails alleging to be from trustworthy entities but have deceptive messages that aims to gain sensitive information.<br>
					Ways to prevent this attack include creating a security-conscious work culture, implementing two-factor authentication, using phishing detection tools, and using common sense.<br>
					4. Man in the middle attacks - occurs when a hacker inserts themselves into a communication session between two parties and eavesdrops to steal sensitive information.<br>
					Ways to prevent this attack include paying attention to security certificate warnings, and using secured networks.<br>
					5. Malware attacks - malicious software is designed to destroy or disrupt a computer. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware.<br>
					Ways to prevent this attack include browsing cautiously, using good software, and acting quickly. (Adams, 2022).<br>
